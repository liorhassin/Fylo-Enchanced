## About The Project

This component has some interesting CSS challenges in the design. If you're looking to test your CSS skills, this will be a great project for you!
The main challenge is to build out this data storage component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:
1. View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
2. Upload images and see the progress bar/other parameters change accordingly.
3. Refresh the page and have the entire data saved(local storage).
